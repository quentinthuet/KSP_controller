# KSP_controller

Arduino - Kerbal Space Program interfacing // Personnal project

The goal of this project is use a home made controller (with joysticks, buttons and leds) in Kerbal Space Program.
KSP is a video game where you have to conduct a Space Program, build rockets and satellites, and launch them.

PROGRESS
I haven't build the controller yet but I already bought all the elecronics.
The code is almost done.

TECHNOLOGIES
I am using a Arduino Mega board to interact with the controller.
The Arduino Mega board sends data to a python code using the serial module.
KSP sends data to the same python code using KRPC.
